# Online Christmas Card 2016
My family's Christmas card on the web, because we were too busy to get them printed.

Coding something outside of work was fun. I took the opportunity to learn a few
things:

* ES6 syntax
* Rolled my own lazy loading
* Simple modal with previous, next, close

Smooth scroll was the only thing I didn't take the time to do myself.
[Zenscroll](https://zengabor.github.io/zenscroll/) was a pretty nice,
lightweight solution.
